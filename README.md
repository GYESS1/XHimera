The Xhimera community would like somebody to takeover this coin, and re-launch this coin.


The coin should have these specs:

     - Unlimited coin supply

     - A flat, stable, consistent block reward for miners that does not change over time.
       It does not increase and it does not decrease over time. 

     - Entirely a POW mined coin

     - The market maker for the coin, the founder of the coin, will need to maintain a "Floor price" for the coin that displays the coin on the website whattomine.com

     - Be a market leader, don't follow the other coins in the market.  Use a target market price for a return of about $3 / day per gpu card.

     - At the beginning, the return per gpu card will be much higher while there are fewer miners participating in the coin.  More miners will join to participate, the hashrate difficulty will increase and reduce the return on mining each day.  Over time market forces, and the founder of the coin that is the market maker, will hopefully bring stability to the coin.   

     - 1:1 conversion of coins for the re-launch.  


The bitcoin formula of a 25 block reward for a 10 minute block time, or a 12.5 block reward for a 5 minute block time is a perfect amount for a flat, stable, and consistent block reward.  This block reward will continue into the future, it will never increase or decrease.  

This will add approximately 5,250,000 over a period of four years, which is an average of 1,312,500 coins each year that are added to the total coin supply.

Place the coin on an exchange at livecoin.net, cryptopia, or coinexchange.io and begin trading the coin.
